Explanation of Both Codes: Without GUI & With GUI 🚀
1️⃣ Without GUI - Console-Based Inventory System (Using AVL Tree, Hash Table & Linked List)
💡 Key Components:
✅ AVL Tree → Stores inventory efficiently (sorted order, balanced)
✅ Hash Table → Enables quick item lookup by name
✅ Linked List (FIFO Queue) → Tracks expiry order

🔹 How It Works:
Adding Items:

Items are stored in an AVL Tree (sorted automatically).
Also added to the Hash Table for quick lookup.
Added to the Linked List (FIFO Queue) to track expiry.
Displaying Inventory:

Performs in-order traversal of AVL Tree to show items in sorted order.
Checking Item Quantity:

Uses Hash Table to get the quantity of any item in O(1) time.
Removing Expired Items:

FIFO Expiry System removes the oldest added item using Linked List.
📜 Example Output:
Current Inventory:
Apples | Quantity: 50 | Price: 10
Bananas | Quantity: 30 | Price: 5
Oranges | Quantity: 40 | Price: 7

Checking Quantity of Bananas: 30

Removing Expired Item: Apples
📌 Efficient Data Structures:

AVL Tree → Keeps inventory sorted.
Hash Table → Ensures fast lookups.
Linked List → Maintains expiry order.
2️⃣ With GUI - Warehouse Inventory System (Swing-Based UI)
💡 Features Added in GUI:
✅ Graphical Interface with JFrame (instead of console output)
✅ JTable to display inventory items
✅ Text Fields & Buttons to add and remove items
✅ JTextArea for tracking expired items

🔹 How It Works:
1️⃣ User Inputs Item Name, Quantity, Price → Clicks "Add Item" → Item is stored
2️⃣ Items appear in JTable (Inventory Table)
3️⃣ Expired items tracked in JTextArea (FIFO order)
4️⃣ Click "Remove Expired Item" → Oldest item is removed (FIFO queue)

📜 How the Code Works:
JTable → Displays inventory items.
JTextField → User enters item details.
JButton → Adds & removes items from inventory.
HashMap → Stores items with quantity.
LinkedList → Maintains FIFO expiry order.
📜 Example GUI Layout:
📌 When you run the GUI version, you will see:

Table: Displays all items with name, quantity & price
Buttons: "Add Item" & "Remove Expired Item"
Expiry Tracking: List of expired items
💡 You can click buttons instead of typing commands in the console!

🚀 Which Version is Better?
🔹 Console-Based Version → Best for fast backend processing.
🔹 GUI Version → Best for user-friendly interaction & visualization.
